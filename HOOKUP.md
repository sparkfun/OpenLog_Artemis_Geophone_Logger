## Background

[Seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology) is the study of earthquakes and other processes that relate to the propagation of elastic waves through the Earth.
If you have ever experienced an earthquake, you'll know exactly what we're talking about. But maybe you've been near a quarry or mine when they've been blasting; you will have experienced seismic waves then too.

You can detect seismic waves with a [seismometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer), which is an instrument that records the timing and characteristics of the motion of the ground.
If you have access to multiple seismometers, you can combine their data to calculate or triangulate the source of an earthquake.

A geophone is essentially a very sensitive, low frequency microphone used to detect the seismic waves. Traditional seismometers recorded the amplitude of the motion of the ground, but with modern electronic equipment it is also possible to study the frequency spectrum of the vibrations too.

We can create a fully digital seismometer by combining a geophone with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) (which digitizes the signal from the geophone) and a microcontroller
(which can perform the frequency analysis and log the results to microSD card). This guide shows you how to create a sophisticated seismometer / geophone logger using the
SparkFun OpenLog Artemis.

## Prepare the geophone

We need to do two things to get the geophone ready to use in our seismometer:
- Add a damping resistor
- Add some stranded hook-up wire

### Add a damping resistor

The SM-24 geophone has a very strong open-loop response at 10Hz (the red line in the plot below). We need to compensate for this by adding a damping resistor

A 1300Ω resistor gives best performance (the green line), but a 1000Ω resistor works well too and only attenuates the signal slightly (the brown line).

![SM-24_Response_Curve.JPG](img/SM-24_Response_Curve.JPG)

Solder the resistor across (in parallel with) the geophone pins. Please follow our [How to Solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) guide
if you are doing this for the first time.

### Add some stranded hook-up wire

We need to solder two lengths of stranded hook-up wire to the geophone pins. This is best done at the same time as when you solder on the damping resistor.

Keep the wires short. 150mm / 6" should be more than enough. After soldering the wires to the geophone pins, twist the wires together (to help minimise noise)
and then strip the ends so they can be inserted into the latch terminals on the Qwiic PT100. For the ADS1219 and ADS1015, you may want to solder the wires to the
PCB, or use header pins and a suitable crimp connector.

## Connect the geophone to the ADC

### SparkX Qwiic 24 Bit ADC - 4 Channel (ADS1219)

The ADS1219 is a four channel ADC with 24-bit resolution. Connect the two wires from the geophone to AIN0 and AIN1. (The polarity does not matter, connect either wire to either terminal.) You may want to use header pins and a suitable crimp connector.

### SparkFun Qwiic 12 Bit ADC - 4 Channel (ADS1015)

The ADS1015 is a four channel ADC with 12-bit resolution. Connect the two wires from the geophone to A0 and A1. (The polarity does not matter, connect either wire to either terminal.)
You may want to use header pins and a suitable crimp connector.

### Qwiic PT100 ADS122C04

The Qwiic PT100 is designed to measure temperature very accurately using a 100Ω Platinum Resistance Thermometer. However, the heart of the Qwiic PT100 is the ADS122C04
24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) which is perfect for digitizing the signal from the geophone. It has a differential input as well as adjustable gain (x1 to x128), which we can use to amplify the small signals from the geophone.

Please check that the A/B/C jumpers on the back of the Qwiic PT100 are open. (They are open by default. Please clear them if you have been using the PT100 for 3-wire or 2-wire sensing.)

Connect the two wires from the geophone to terminals 2 and 3 on the Qwiic PT100. (The polarity does not matter, connect either wire to either terminal.)

**Note:** the Qwiic PT100 has a low pass filter on the input to channels A0 and A1. This helps to reject noise on the PT100 temperature measurements.
For geophone measurements, it may be beneficial to remove the filter. Refer to the [schematic](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/b/6/d/8/Qwiic_PT100-Schematic.pdf).
Replace R6 and R7 with 0 Ohm resistors. Remove C2, C3 and C5.

## Connect the ADC to the OpenLog Artemis

Connect the ADC to the OLA using a Qwiic cable.

## Add the microSD card

CHeck your microSD card is formatted. v2.0 of the geophone logger firmware supports FAT32 and exFAT.

Now insert your microSD card into the socket on the back of the OLA. The card clicks into place.

## Install the OLA geophone logger firmware

Connect the OLA to your computer using a USB-C cable and follow our [upgrade instructions](./UPGRADE.md) to install the latest geophone logger firmware binary on the OLA.

## Start logging

You are now ready to start logging data. If you are familiar with the Arduino IDE, you can open the Serial Monitor to see the menus and data from the OLA.

Alternatively, you can use a terminal emulator like Tera Term to see the data. Just make sure it is set to 115,200 Baud.

If you hit any key (send any character) the main menu will open allowing you to change the OLA's settings.

## What's under the hood?

The Artemis is doing all of the hard work for you: sampling the geophone signal, converting the samples to frequency data using a Fast Fourier Transform, and logging each reading
to microSD card.

You can adjust the gain of the ADC using the **Configure Attached Devices** menu option. You can also set the amplitude threshold that the peak signal needs to exceed before it
is logged to SD card using the **Configure Geophone Threshold** menu option. This allows you to avoid logging all of the background noise between seismic waves.

The SM-24 geophone has a useful frequency range of 240Hz, so we need to be logging at 480Hz or more to be able to capture data across the full frequency range.
Have a look at [Nyquist-Shannon sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem) to find out why. We round the 480Hz up to 500Hz to make life easier for ourselves.
The ADC sample rate is set higher than this, to make sure we have a new conversion ready every 2 milliseconds.

The [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) functions we use to convert the ADC samples into a frequency spectrum like to use data sizes that are powers of two.
We actually take 1024 samples at 500Hz before we start the FFT conversion and so we get new frequency data every ~two seconds. The OLA logs "frequency bins" 1 to 501 which corresponds to
0.5Hz to 250.5Hz in 0.5Hz increments.

If you enable Serial Plotter mode using menu option 1 followed by menu option 3, you can use the Arduino IDE Serial Plotter tool to plot the data for you.
The left of the window is 0.5Hz, the right is 250.5Hz. The vertical bars correspond to intervals of 50Hz. (We're fortunate that the Serial Plotter can plot
500 values at a time!) You will see fresh data scroll in every two seconds; the scrolling speed is baud rate dependent (it takes approximately half a second
for the fresh data to scroll across at 115200 baud). The Y-axis scales automatically depending on the peak amplitude. It is normal to see low amplitude 'noise'
displayed when there is no seismic activity.

If you look at the data in the files created on the microSD card, you'll see that there are 501 columns of data after the date and time. The 501st column contains the peak frequency signal in Hz.

![SerialPlotter.gif](img/SerialPlotter.gif)

The OLA geophone logger firmware uses two sample buffers so we can sample continuously. Fresh samples are recorded into one buffer while the other buffer is being analyzed using the FFT.

With no seismic activity, you will see a noisy low level signal. Tap your workbench and you'll see a large response. You can set the amplitude threshold to avoid logging all of that noise.

You can choose to log the date and time from the Artemis' Real Time Clock (RTC). (Why wouldn't you!?). You can also log a count which increments with each sample.
